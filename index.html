            <div id="ParaInit"><h3>About Wabi Sabi:</h3>
                <p>Wabi Sabi is a traditional Japanese worldview/aesthetic, and is the most influential feature of traditional Japanese beauty. There is no direct translation of the term into English, but "wabi" means something along the lines of "rustic simplicity and/or quietness" while "sabi" refers to the beauty and serenity that comes with age. This Doodle explores many of the different ways Wabi Sabi is expressed in Japanese arts to help people better understand what it is about.</p></div>
            <div id="ParaBons"><h3>About Bonsai:</h3>
                <p>Japanese bonsai is the art of growing trees in small pots with the intention of creating miniature recreations of regular sized trees. Growing a bonsai is supposed to be a very personal experience, being an exercise in patience and perseverance. While a lot of human care is required to maintain a bonsai, the gardeners of these trees specifically aim to make the tree look as though no human hand touched it. </p></div>
            <div id="ParaHagi"><h3>About Hagi and Raku Pottery:</h3>
                <p>Hagi and Raku are two types of Japanese pottery, commonly used in the creation of teacups for Japanese tea ceremonies. Both forms of pottery are known for their uneven, hand thrown appearance, with colors that are very natural and muted in appearance. They are also both highly porous forms of pottery. Raku, which is usually the preferred type of pottery for tea ceremonies, is often darker in color with the use of glazes containing metals like copper or cobalt, while Hagi is usually lighter with subtle beige glazing.</p></div>
            <div id="ParaZen"><h3>About Zen Gardens:</h3>
                <p>Japanese rock gardens, often known as zen gardens, are a form of japanese landscaping, tied to the practice of zen buddhism. Zen gardens consist of small islands of rocks sometimes with moss and/or small trees and bushes in and around them, between which an area of sand or gravel is raked into ripple patterns to mimic the look of water. Enclosed by a wall on 3 and meant to be viewed from a small point at the edge of the garden, these rock gardens aimed to mimic the appearance of nature without being nature so that people could meditate on the meaning of existence.</p></div>
            <div id="ParaIke"><h3>About Ikebana Flower Arangement:</h3>
                <p>Ikebana is the japanese art of flower arrangement. This unique style of arranging flowers is born out of a combination of buddhist and shinto flower arrangement practices. Ikebana arrangements were originally found mostly at altars, but now also exist within small alcoves in traditional japanese style rooms. Ikebana uses not only flowers but also branches, leaves, and stems, with the goal of creating arrangements that bring out the inner qualities of the plants “give life” to the arrangement. Visually, ikebana stands out among other flower arrangement techniques with its strong vertical forms that stick quite high out of the top of the vases.  </p></div>
            <div id="ParaKin"><h3>About Kintsugi:</h3>
                <p>Kintsugi is a japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, highlighting the damage and the flaws of the pottery instead of aiming to hide it. One of the Japanese art forms that most highlights the concept of wabi-sabi, Kintsugi embraces flaws and imperfections, the natural flow of time, an acceptance of fate, and the beauty of change.</p></div>
