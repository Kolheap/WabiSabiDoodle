                <p>Wabi Sabi is a traditional Japanese worldview/aesthetic, and is the most influential feature of traditional Japanese beauty. There is no direct translation of the term into English, but "wabi" means something along the lines of "rustic simplicity and/or quietness" while "sabi" refers to the beauty and serenity that comes with age.
